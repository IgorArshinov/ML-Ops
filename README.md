# ML-Ops

During the Postgraduate Applied Artificial Intelligence program I created this project as an assignment for the Machine Learning Operations course.

Terraform and Amazon AWS are used to create the infrastructure. With the GitHub actions it's possible to retrain the ML model everytime the data.dvc file is changed.
